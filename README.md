But when he?s accepted into NYU?s Promising Young Artist program for his senior year, the future suddenly feels like a blank canvas.However, it soon becomes clear that the city has peculiar ties to his past. A thunderstorm finds him under the same umbrella as an eerily familiar green-eyed girl. A visit to an art gallery brings him face-to-face with a heavily tattooed portrait of himself. He sees things that aren?t there?at least not anymore. And the girl he?s falling in love with is somehow at the center of it all.When history suddenly points to a devastating future, Evan must race against time to figure out who is pulling the strings and change the green-eyed girl?s fate?a race he?s already lost twice.For readers who enjoy Strange Unearthly Things by Kelly Creagh, The Bad Ones by Melissa </p>
